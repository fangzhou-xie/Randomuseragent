The goal of Randomuseragent is to have a easy access to different user-agent strings
by randomly sampling from a pool of real strings.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of Randomuseragent from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("Randomuseragent") -->
<!-- ``` -->

The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fangzhou-xie/Randomuseragent")
```

The package is currently under active development and will be submitted to CRAN soon.

## Example

This is a basic example to get random user-agent strings:

```{r example}
library(Randomuseragent)

random_useragent()

filter_useragent(min_obs = 50000, software_name = "Safari", operating_system_name = "macOS")
```

Both function will accept the same set of arguments for filtering user-agent strings. Please refer
to documentation of either function for details.

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
